        <p><b>Kode and Adrian have stopped maintaining this as it's against ToS for discord, however it will remain here for users to download and run. With help from Kode I will continue to make sure that MantaroSelf runs, however I will not be able to assist anyone in running this, and asking for help in the Mantaro server is not allowed anymore.</b></p>

        <h2>Konachan notice (net.kodehawa.lib.imageboard.konachan)</h2>
        <p>That package is a port of the <a href="https://github.com/Mxrck/KonachanLib"><b>original konachan library</b></a> to Java 8 and to better suit our needs. I just didn't want to post it on GitHub as a separate lib, but if anyone wants I'll do so.</p>
